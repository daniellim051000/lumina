✻ Thinking…

  Looking at the conversation summary, I can see that the user has been asking me to fix a specific issue: 
  when a user enters a wrong password, the username field gets cleared along with the password field, but 
  they want only the password field to be cleared while keeping the username.

  I've made several attempts to fix this, including:
  1. Adding logic to clear only password in catch block
  2. Adding useEffect to handle clearing based on error state  
  3. Storing username before submission and trying to restore it
  4. Adding setTimeout to handle React's async state updates
  5. Combined useEffect with stored username approach

  The user has tested these attempts and shown console logs proving that:
  - The logic is working (the state shows correct data)
  - But the UI doesn't reflect the state (username field appears empty)
  - The useEffect isn't even triggering

  I just added debug logging to track all formData changes. The user's most recent message was "is still not
   working, the issue is still exist. Think Ultrahard for a solution to this"

  I need to think ultrahard about what could be causing this. The issue seems to be that React state 
  contains the correct data but the UI input field doesn't reflect it. This suggests:

  1. The input's value prop might not be correctly bound to the state
  2. There could be component re-mounting that's clearing the inputs
  3. React's batched state updates might be causing timing issues
  4. There might be a controlled component issue

  Let me look at the current SignIn component and think about what could be wrong...

  Looking at the SignIn component, I can see:
  - The input has value={formData.username} which should be correct
  - The handleInputChange function updates the state correctly
  - The console logs show the state is correct but UI doesn't reflect it

  Wait, I think I see a potential issue. Let me trace through what happens:

  1. User enters wrong password
  2. handleSubmit calls signIn(formData)
  3. signIn throws an error

  4. The catch block doesn't actually run in handleSubmit - the error is thrown and caught by the error 
  boundary or React
  5. The useEffect tries to restore the form but there might be timing issues

  I'm noticing a critical pattern emerging. The error handling mechanism seems broken, preventing proper 
  state restoration. The disconnect between state and UI suggests a deeper issue with how errors are being 
  caught and managed. Something is interrupting the normal flow of state updates, potentially causing the 
  input to reset unexpectedly.

  The multiple state variables in the SignIn component create a complex interaction that might be disrupting
   form restoration. The interplay between AuthContext error state, form data, and other component states 
  could be causing unexpected behavior. I suspect there's a race condition or an overriding mechanism that's
   preventing the form from maintaining its state after an error occurs.

  The potential culprit could be how the error is propagated through different state management layers, 
  possibly causing unintended side effects that clear the form data prematurely.

  I'm considering a strategic approach to preserve form data by intercepting the clearing mechanism. By 
  storing values before the API call and implementing a more robust state management strategy, I might 
  prevent the unexpected form reset. A ref-based solution could provide more direct control over input 
  values, bypassing potential state synchronization issues.

⏺ Looking at the console logs and the persistent issue, I think the problem is a React controlled
  component synchronization issue. The state has the correct data but the UI isn't reflecting it. Let me
   try a different approach using refs to directly control the input values.

✻ Thinking…

  The user has lots of background processes running, but I need to focus on the main issue. Let me add the 
  refs and implement a solution that directly manipulates the input values to bypass the React state 
  synchronization issue.

       19 +    // Refs to directly control input values
       20 +    const usernameRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

       22 +  
       23      // Debug: Log every time formData changes
       24      useEffect(() => {
       25        console.log('🔍 SignIn: FormData changed to:', formData);

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to update the useEffect to use the refs to directly set the input values instead of just 
  updating the state. This should bypass any React state synchronization issues.

       46              username: submittedUsername,
       47              password: ''
       48            });
       49 +          
       50 +          // Also directly set input values using refs to ensure UI updates
       51 +          if (usernameRef.current) {
       52 +            usernameRef.current.value = submittedUsername;
       53 +            console.log('🔍 SignIn: Directly set username input to:', submittedUsername);
       54 +          }
       55 +          if (passwordRef.current) {
       56 +            passwordRef.current.value = '';
       57 +            console.log('🔍 SignIn: Directly cleared password input');
       58 +          }
       59 +          
       60            console.log('🔍 SignIn: useEffect completed form restoration');
       61          }
       62        }

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to add the refs to the actual input elements so that they can be controlled directly.

       137                  name="username"

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to add the ref to the password input as well.

       160                    type={showPassword ? 'text' : 'password'}
       161                    id="password"
       162                    name="password"

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have added refs to both input elements and updated the useEffect to directly manipulate the input 
  values using refs in addition to updating the React state. This should bypass any React state 
  synchronization issues.

  The approach is:
  1. When an error occurs and it's determined to be a password-related error
  2. Update the React state as before (for consistency)
  3. Also directly set the input values using refs to ensure the UI updates immediately

  This hybrid approach should work because:
  - The refs give us direct DOM access to force the UI to update
  - The state updates keep React's internal state consistent
  - The console logs will help us verify that both the direct DOM manipulation and state updates are working

  Let me summarize what I've done:

  1. Added useRef hooks for both username and password inputs
  2. Added ref props to both input elements
  3. Modified the useEffect to use refs to directly set input values in addition to updating state
  4. Added console logs to track when the direct DOM manipulation happens

  This should solve the issue where the React state had the correct values but the UI wasn't reflecting 
  them. The user can now test this new implementation.

⏺ I've implemented a new approach using refs to directly control the input values. This should solve the
   React state synchronization issue you've been experiencing.

  What I changed:

  1. Added refs for direct DOM access:
  const usernameRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
  const passwordRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
  2. Added ref props to both input elements
  3. Enhanced the useEffect to use both state updates AND direct DOM manipulation:
  // Update state (for React consistency)
  setFormData({
    username: submittedUsername,
    password: ''
  });

  // Also directly set input values using refs to ensure UI updates
  if (usernameRef.current) {
    usernameRef.current.value = submittedUsername;
  }
  if (passwordRef.current) {
    passwordRef.current.value = '';
  }

  Why this should work:

  The previous issue was that React state contained the correct data but the UI inputs weren't
  reflecting it. By using refs to directly manipulate the DOM input values, we bypass React's state
  synchronization entirely while still keeping the React state consistent.

  Test it now:

  1. Enter a username (e.g., "testuser") and wrong password
  2. Submit the form
  3. Check the console logs - you should see:
    - The usual formData change logs
    - New logs showing direct input manipulation: "Directly set username input to: testuser"
    - The username field should now stay populated while password field clears

  This hybrid approach ensures both React state consistency and reliable UI updates.
